//?If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
//BFS -> Starts searching the closest node to the parent;

//?If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
//BFS -> beacuse the solutions are rare we have to go over and over each br

//?If the tree is very wide:
//DFS -> memory wise if the speed in not important

//?If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
//DFS -> memory wise if the speed in not important

//?Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
//DFS

//?Finding the shortest path:
//BFS
